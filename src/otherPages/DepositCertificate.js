          <h1>Why Choose Certificates of Deposit?</h1>
          <p>
            Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are a low-risk investment option offered by banks and credit unions. They provide a fixed 
            interest rate for a specified term, making them a predictable and secure choice for investors seeking stable returns. 
            With our CD services, you can explore various options tailored to your financial goals and make informed decisions for 
            growing your savings safely.
